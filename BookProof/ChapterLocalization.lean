# Chapter "Real representations, CPT theorem and the relativistic position operator",
§"Localization", **Proposition 88 / Corollary 1** — the algebraic localization obstruction

`book.tex` (§"Localization") proves **Proposition 88** ("for any complex localizable
unitary representation ... if it contains a positive energy representation then it also
contains the corresponding negative energy representation") and **Corollary 1** ("a
localizable Poincaré representation is an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group
including parity iff it is real and massive spin 1/2 or massless helicity 1/2").

Both proofs turn on a single concrete algebraic fact about the Majorana matrices:

> "the subspaces defined by the projectors involving the `iγ⁰`s ... are **not conserved**
> by the system of imprimitivity **because `γ⁰` does not commute with the matrices
> `γ⃗γ⁰`** present in the transformation from momenta to coordinate space."

Working in the concrete real Majorana model of `BookProof.ChapterA3` (`M_μ = iγ^μ`, so
`γ^μ = -i M_μ`), this file formalizes exactly that obstruction. Writing `A = iγ⁰` and, for
each spatial index `i ∈ {1,2,3}`, `B_i = (iγⁱ)(iγ⁰)` (the real Majorana image of `γⁱγ⁰`
up to a scalar), the commutator is computed in closed form:

  `[A, B_i] = A B_i − B_i A = 2 (iγⁱ) ≠ 0`.

The mechanism is the Clifford algebra: `{iγ⁰, iγⁱ} = 0` and `(iγ⁰)² = −1`, so
`A B_i = A (iγⁱ) A = −(iγⁱ) A² = iγⁱ` while `B_i A = (iγⁱ) A² = −iγⁱ`. Since `iγⁱ ≠ 0`,
`A` and `B_i` do **not** commute — the projector onto an `iγ⁰`-eigenspace is not preserved,
which is the crux of Prop 88 and Corollary 1.

The full statements of Prop 88 / Corollary 1 (systems of imprimitivity, direct-sum
decompositions of unitary Poincaré representations) are analytic and remain prose; this
file isolates their load-bearing algebraic core, decidably over the integer Majorana model
and then transported to the complex model.

This stays off the gravity line and off the Hankel-transform line, per the roadmap.
Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.

/-! ### The spatial rotation generators do commute with `iγ⁰`

The contrast that makes the little-group picture of Proposition 79 (massive case,
`G_l = SU(2)`) consistent: while the *boost*-type generators `(iγⁱ)(iγ⁰)` fail to
commute with `iγ⁰` (above), the *rotation* generators `(iγⁱ)(iγʲ)` with both indices
spatial **do** commute with `iγ⁰`, so they preserve the `iγ⁰`-eigenspaces and generate
the massive little group. -/
