# Every finite prior is a posterior from uniform prior and suitable data

This file formalizes the next self-contained Bayesian claim in `book.tex` around
lines 1749--1760: results obtained from a non-uniform prior can be represented
using a uniform prior with suitable data.

For a finite target distribution `q`, use binary data and the likelihood
`L x true = q x`, `L x false = 1 - q x`.  Every row of `L` is a probability
distribution.  Conditioning any positive constant (uniform) prior on `true`
then returns exactly `q`.
