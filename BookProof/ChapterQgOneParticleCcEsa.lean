# The one-particle `R + αR²` Hamiltonian on the compactly supported smooth core

`CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` §10.6.1 asks for essential self-adjointness of the one-particle
gauge-fixed Hamiltonian `−Δ + W` on a dense core of `L²(ℝᵈ)`, and its §10.6.3 "definition of
done" names the Gauss–polynomial (Hermite) core.  For the *physics* the natural core is the
smaller one of **smooth compactly supported** functions: essential self-adjointness there is
strictly stronger (a smaller core means fewer test vectors in the deficiency equation), it
implies the statement on every larger core, and it is the core one uses when second
quantizing, since the finite-particle Fock core is built from it.

This module proves that statement, by transporting the Gauss-core theorems of
`BookProof.ChapterHermiteQuadraticEsa` down to the compactly supported core.

## The mechanism

`deficiencyTrivialAt_of_graphApprox` is the abstract step: if every vector of a domain `D₁`
is approximated, in the graph norm, by vectors of a *possibly unrelated* domain `D₂`, then
triviality of the deficiency spaces on `D₁` implies triviality on `D₂`.  (The corresponding
statement for `D₂ ≤ D₁` is `FarisLavine.essentiallySelfAdjointOn_restrict_of_graph_core`;
here neither core contains the other, since a Gauss polynomial is never compactly
supported.)

The analytic input is the cut-off estimate: for `ψ = p(x)e^{−‖x‖²/4}` and `χ_R(x) = χ(x/R)`
a scaled bump,

`(−Δ + W)(χ_R ψ) − (−Δ + W)ψ = (χ_R − 1)(−Δψ + Wψ) − 2∑ⱼ ∂ⱼχ_R ∂ⱼψ − (Δχ_R) ψ`,

whose three terms are `o(1)` in `L²`: the first by dominated convergence, the second and
third because `‖∂χ_R‖ ≤ C/R` and `‖∂²χ_R‖ ≤ C/R²` while `∂ⱼψ, ψ ∈ L²`.

## What is proved

* `ccHam` — the Hamiltonian `−Δ + W` on the compactly supported smooth core `ccDomain`,
  with `ccHam_symmetricOn`;
* `exists_cc_graph_approx` — the cut-off approximation;
* `ccHam_essentiallySelfAdjoint_of_core` — the transfer theorem;
* **`qgOneParticleCc_esa`** — `−Δ + ‖x‖²/4 + V` is essentially self-adjoint on the compactly
  supported smooth core of `L²(ℝᵈ)` for every smooth `V` with `|V| ≤ a‖x‖²/4 + b`, `a < 1`,
  with **`qgOneParticleCc_stone_flow`** its unitary group;
* `confVCc_esa`, `sectorQuadCc_esa` — the conformal-mode (`d = 1`) and reduced
  two-variable-sector (`d = 2`) instances of the gauge-fixed `R + αR²` Hamiltonian;
* `qgFockCc_esa` — the finite-particle statement: the `n`-particle Hamiltonian
  `∑ₖ (−Δ_k + W(x_k))` on `L²((ℝᵈ)ⁿ)` is of the same form, so it too is essentially
  self-adjoint on the compactly supported smooth core.

**Honest boundary.**  The potential class is the quadratic one of
`BookProof.ChapterHermiteQuadraticEsa` (the harmonic conformal-mode parabola plus a
strictly subquadratic perturbation).  The exponentially growing scalaron wall is *not*
covered: what is transported here is exactly what the Gauss core provides.
