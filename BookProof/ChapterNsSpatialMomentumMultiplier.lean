# The Plancherel identification and the diagonal spatial derivative

Part of item 1 of the Navier–Stokes plan items of `CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md`: *the spatial Fourier
unitary and the diagonal derivative*.  The item asks for the Plancherel identification of the
one-particle space and for the statement that on it the spatial derivative `−i ∂_{x_j}` is the
Fourier multiplier of the real symbol `p_j`.

What is proved here, for an arbitrary finite-dimensional real inner-product space `V` carrying the
volume measure:

* `l2Fourier` — the Plancherel identification of `L²(V)` with itself in the momentum variable, as a
  linear isometry equivalence (Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Lp.fourierTransformₗᵢ`), with
  `l2Fourier_norm` and `l2Fourier_inner` the unitarity statements;
* `fourier_opL2_eq_mulSymbol` — **the multiplier statement at the `L²` level**: if the Fourier
  transform turns a Schwartz operator `P` into multiplication by the real symbol `σ`, then on the
  Schwartz core the Plancherel identification carries the `L²` realization of `P` to multiplication
  by `σ`.  This upgrades the pointwise Schwartz-space identity of
  `BookProof.FourierMultiplierEsa` to the Hilbert space where the operator lives;
* `fourier_opL2_firstOrderOp` and `fourier_opL2_momentumOp` — the specialization to the momentum
  operators: `∑_j c_j (−i ∂_{w_j})` becomes multiplication by `∑_j 2π c_j ⟪ξ, w_j⟫`, and `−i ∂_m`
  becomes multiplication by `2π ⟪ξ, m⟫` — the real symbol `p_j` of the plan item;
* `foSymbolFn_add_fibre` and `foSymbolFn_congr_of_inner_eq` — **the derivative is diagonal in the
  spatial momentum and blind to the fibre**: the symbol of a family of *spatial* directions is
  unchanged when the frequency is moved by any vector orthogonal to all of them, so it depends on
  the spatial frequency only;
* `spatialMomentum_esa` — essential self-adjointness of the spatial momentum family on the
  Schwartz core (`BookProof.FourierMultiplierEsa.firstOrderOp_essentiallySelfAdjoint`), so the
  derivative side of the construction is a proved instrument.

**Honest boundary.**  The identification used is the *full* Plancherel transform of `L²(V)`; the
partial ("spatial-only") transform `L²(ℝ_x^d × ℝ_u^m) ≅ L²(ℝ_p^d × ℝ_u^m)`, which transforms the
spatial variable and leaves the fibre variable alone, is **not** constructed here.  What is proved
instead is that the symbol of a spatial derivative does not see the fibre frequency
(`foSymbolFn_add_fibre`), which is the content the route uses: the spatial derivative is diagonal
in the spatial momentum and acts as the identity on the fibre.  The remaining part of plan item 1
is therefore the construction of the partial transform itself.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
