# Chapter G III — commutative von Neumann algebra, Mehler = uniform measure,
incomplete unconstrained gauge-fixing, Haar invariantization, QFT vacuum

This file formalizes work-package **G.18–G.22** of `FORMALIZATION_ROADMAP.md`
(the "Chapter G extension (Mehler measure)"), the last self-contained gauge-
theory claims of the book's gauge-symmetry chapter (`book.tex` lines 1426–1441
and 2329–2488).

Sections:
* **G.18** the algebraic measure theory: events ↔ projections of a *commutative*
  algebra (`book.tex` 1426–1441). Intersection/union of events is represented by
  products/sums of the associated idempotent projections, the algebra is
  commutative, and the state is the linear functional assigning to each
  projection its probability.
* **G.19** the Mehler prior = the uniform measure of a high-dimensional sphere
  (`book.tex` 2488, 3845). It is a probability measure, invariant under the
  orthogonal (gauge) group, and concentrated on the sphere of radius `√k`.
  Reuses the sorry-free Mehler formalism of `PnpProof.SphereGaussian`.
* **G.20** the incomplete unconstrained gauge-fixing: the remnant gauge symmetry
  is a *faithful* (hence non-trivial) representation, and a non-trivial gauge
  transformation of a *free* remnant action modifies every point of the spectrum
  (`book.tex` 2329–2348).
* **G.21** Haar invariantization: averaging a probability measure over a finite
  gauge group produces a gauge-invariant probability measure (`book.tex`
  2371–2390).
* **G.22** the QFT vacuum: the free-field Gaussian ("Gaussian measure for the
  position and velocity", `book.tex` 2488) is a probability measure invariant
  under the orthogonal gauge group.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (no `EXTERNAL` hypothesis).

/-! ## G.18 — Algebraic measure theory: events as projections of a commutative algebra

`book.tex` 1426–1441: every commutative von Neumann algebra on a separable
Hilbert space is isomorphic to `L^∞(X,μ)`; the boolean algebra of events is
represented inside this *commutative* algebra by self-adjoint idempotent
projections, with intersection/union represented by products/sums and the state
by a linear functional assigning a probability to each projection. -/

  funext x; by_cases h : x ∈ A <;> simp [eventProj, Set.indicator, h]

/-- The commutative-algebra property: the event projections commute. -/

    simp [eventProj, Set.indicator, hA, hB]

    simp [eventProj, Set.indicator, Pi.add_apply, Pi.sub_apply, Pi.mul_apply, hA, hB]

/-- The state is the linear functional that assigns to each projection its
probability: integrating the projection of `A` against a probability measure
returns `μ A` (`book.tex` 1436–1441). -/

/-! ## G.19 — The Mehler prior is the uniform measure of a high-dimensional sphere

`book.tex` 2488, 3845: the prior is the "uniform measure of an infinite-
dimensional sphere". We reuse the sorry-free Mehler formalism of
`PnpProof.SphereGaussian`: `sphereUniform k` is a probability measure, invariant
under every orthogonal (gauge) transformation, and concentrated on the sphere of
radius `√k`. -/

/-! ## G.20 — Incomplete unconstrained gauge-fixing: faithful remnant symmetry

`book.tex` 2329–2348: an incomplete unconstrained gauge-fixing retains a
*remnant* gauge symmetry that is a *faithful* (thus non-trivial) representation
of the original gauge group, and "any non-trivial gauge transformation
necessarily modifies any point of the spectrum". -/

/-- The remnant gauge symmetry is non-trivial: a faithful action of a non-trivial
group moves some point of the spectrum. -/

/-- "Any non-trivial gauge transformation necessarily modifies any point of the
spectrum": for a *free* remnant action, every non-identity gauge element moves
every point. -/

/-! ## G.21 — Haar invariantization: averaging over a finite gauge group

`book.tex` 2371–2390: "a constant measure (Haar measure) always exists which
allows to create a functional which is gauge invariant". For a finite gauge
group we build the invariantized measure explicitly by averaging the pushforwards
of a probability measure over all group elements; the result is a gauge-invariant
probability measure. -/

position and (unconstrained) velocity". The free-field vacuum is the standard
Gaussian on the configuration space, a probability measure invariant under the
orthogonal gauge group. -/
