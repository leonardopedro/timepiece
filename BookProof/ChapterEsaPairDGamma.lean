# The essentially-self-adjoint one-particle package, and `dΓ` over it

This module packages the data of the second quantization theorem in the form in which the
hypothesis "`A` is **essentially** self-adjoint on `D`" is naturally supplied: a symmetric
operator `A` on the domain `D₂` of its closure, together with a subspace `D ≤ D₂` which is a
**core** — graph-norm dense in `D₂`.  The operator one is really given is the restriction
`A|_D`; the pair records the ambient operator through which it is analysed.

**No positivity anywhere.**  Nothing in the package or in its consequences asks for a lower
bound on the spectrum: the only quantitative facts used are the graph norm `‖x‖ + ‖A x‖` and
the Pythagoras identity `‖A x - d i x‖² = ‖A x‖² + d² ‖x‖²`, valid for *every* symmetric
operator (`BookProof.FarisLavine.norm_sub_smul_sq`, recorded here as
`ESAPair.norm_sub_smul_sq`).  The imaginary shift `± i` is what makes `A ± i` bounded below,
irrespective of the sign of the spectrum, so operators unbounded below — the momentum
operator, a Dirac operator, or simply `-id` — are covered on the same footing as positive
ones.  In particular no quadratic form domain and no Friedrichs extension appear.

## Contents

* `ESAPair` — the package: a symmetric one-particle operator, its sectorwise input, and a
  graph-norm core;
* `ESAPair.toOp` — the operator actually given, the restriction to the core;
* `ESAPair.norm_sub_smul_sq` — the Pythagoras identity, valid with no semiboundedness;
* `ESAPair.dGammaOp` — the second quantization on the finite-particle domain over the core;
* `ESAPair.dGamma_essentiallySelfAdjoint` — **the main theorem** in packaged form;
* `ESAPair.dGamma_symmetricOn`, `ESAPair.exists_ne_zero_mem_domain` — symmetry and
  non-vacuity;
* `ESAPair.ofBounded` — a package for every bounded symmetric one-particle operator and every
  dense core, with no positivity: by
  `BookProof.BoundedDGamma.essentiallySelfAdjointOn_fockSectorDom_bounded` its sectorwise
  input is proved, not assumed.

Nothing is assumed: the module contains no `axiom` and no `sorry`.

/-- **An essentially self-adjoint one-particle operator, packaged as a core of a reference
operator.**  `closureOp` is the operator on the domain `D₂ = closureDomain` of the closure,
`coreDomain` is the small domain `D` on which the operator is really given, and `is_core`
says that `D` is graph-norm dense in `D₂`.  `sector_esa` is the one-particle input at the
level of the sectors: essential self-adjointness of `dΓ(closureOp)⁽ⁿ⁾` on the tensor power of
`closureDomain`, which is the statement for a *self-adjoint* one-particle operator.

No positivity, semiboundedness or order structure is required of `closureOp`. -/

/-- **Pythagoras for a symmetric operator, with no semiboundedness.**  `A x` and `d i x` are
orthogonal because `⟪A x, x⟫` is real, so `‖A x - d i x‖² = ‖A x‖² + d² ‖x‖²` and `A - d i` is
bounded below by `|d|` — whatever the sign of the spectrum of `A`.  This is the only
quantitative input of the whole route, and it is where positivity would have entered had the
argument gone through quadratic forms. -/

/-- **Main theorem, packaged form.**  For an essentially self-adjoint one-particle operator —
given as a reference symmetric operator together with a graph-norm core `D`, with no

operator is not assumed positive — `B = -id` is allowed, and then `dΓ(B)` is unbounded below —
