# The quantum-gravity one-particle Hamiltonian on the Hermite core: symmetry,
semiboundedness, and the Friedrichs extension

`CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` §10.6.1 asks for the one-particle gauge-fixed `R + αR²`
Hamiltonian `H = −Δ + W` to be realized as a genuine operator on the
Gauss–polynomial (Hermite) core of `L²(ℝᵈ)` — the basis the SIRK numerics work
in — and for a self-adjoint realization of it.  Target 1 (well-definedness:
`H` maps the core into `L²`) is `BookProof.ChapterQgHermiteCore`.  This module
takes the next step:

* the kinetic term is realized **algebraically** on the core.  Differentiating
  `pgFun p = p(x) e^{−‖x‖²/4}` in the coordinate `j` multiplies the polynomial by
  the *twisted derivative* `coreD j p = ∂ⱼ p − ½ xⱼ p` (`hasDerivAt_pgFun_coord`),
  so the Laplacian acts on the core as the polynomial map
  `kinPoly p = −∑ⱼ coreD j (coreD j p)` (`pgFun_kinPoly`);
* `coreD j` is **antisymmetric** for the Gaussian pairing (`gaussInt_coreD`),
  which is the polynomial form of integration by parts — the analytic input is
  the project's `gaussInt_pderiv`;
* consequently `H = −Δ + W` on the core (`hamCore`) is **symmetric**
  (`hamCore_symmetricOn`) and **bounded below by the lower bound of the
  potential** (`hamCore_quadForm_ge`, `hamCore_quadForm_nonneg`): the kinetic
  quadratic form is the sum of the squared norms of the first derivatives;
* since the core is dense (`polyGaussCore_dense`), the Friedrichs machinery of
  `BookProof.ChapterFriedrichsExtension` yields a **semibounded self-adjoint
  extension** with the same lower bound (`hermiteCore_friedrichs_extension`),
  and a *positive* one when the potential is nonnegative
  (`hermiteCore_friedrichs_extension_of_nonneg`).

The named instances are the ones §10.6.1 asks for: the one-variable **scalaron**
Hamiltonian `−Δ + V(φ)` (`qgOneParticleHermite_friedrichs`) — unconditional, no
finite-speed hypothesis, and with the exponentially growing potential the
temperate-growth theorems cannot reach — and the reduced two-variable sector
`(R_c, φ)` with the conformal-mode parabola
(`qgOneParticleSector_friedrichs`).

**Honest boundary.**  This is the *existence and canonical choice* of a
self-adjoint realization, not the *uniqueness* of one: essential
self-adjointness on the core (§10.6.1 target 4) is not proved here, and no
statement of this module asserts it.  It is proved elsewhere for the two cases
now available — the harmonic potential (`BookProof.ChapterQgHermiteOscillatorEsa`)
and the potential term alone, exponential growth included
(`BookProof.ChapterScalaronHermiteEsa`).
