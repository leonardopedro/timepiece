# Arbitrary finite Bayesian hierarchies

This module makes the “as many levels as we wish” claim in §11 of
*Aligned deep learning as a random sampling method* (`book.tex` around line
10484) explicit for a homogeneous finite latent-state space.  A list of
conditional kernels is collapsed to one kernel.  The collapse remains a
normalized nonnegative kernel, concatenation becomes kernel composition, and
recursively marginalizing through every level agrees with one marginalization
through the collapsed kernel.
