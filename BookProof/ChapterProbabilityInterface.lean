# Probability as an interface between measurable theories

A measurable equivalence transports a probability law by `Measure.map`; the
inverse transports it back.  This gives a rigorous form of translation between
isomorphic standard measurable presentations without claiming that arbitrary
unrelated standard probability spaces are isomorphic.
