# Casimir constraints, Haar averaging and the pushforward of the constrained measure

This module formalizes the three remaining analytic claims of the section
*"Gauge transformations, constrained systems and conditioned probability"* of
`book.tex` (lines 2221–2400), which the companion modules
`BookProof.ChapterGaugeIncompleteFixing` and
`BookProof.ChapterGaugeComprehensiveFixing` do not cover.

## 1. Casimir constraints (`book.tex` 2383–2387)

> "Note that it suffices to constrain to zero the Casimir operators of the
> (eventually non-commutative) Lie algebra of constraints, this imposes the
> constraints without the need for the constraints to be part of the commutative
> von Neumann algebra, only the Casimir operators are included in the commutative
> algebra."

For symmetric (Hermitian) constraint generators `T a`, the quadratic Casimir
`C = ∑ a, T a ∘ T a` satisfies `⟪v, C v⟫ = ∑ a, ‖T a v‖²` (`inner_casimir`), so
`C v = 0` **iff** every constraint annihilates `v`
(`casimir_apply_eq_zero_iff`); equivalently `ker C = ⨅ a, ker (T a)`
(`ker_casimir`).  Constraining the single operator `C` to zero therefore imposes
all the constraints at once, exactly as the book asserts.

## 2. The Haar average produces the gauge-invariant functional (`book.tex` 2377)

> "for a locally compact gauge group (a Lie group, for instance), a constant
> measure (Haar measure) always exists which allows to create a functional which
> is gauge invariant."

`gaugeAverage μ f x = ∫ g, f (g • x) ∂μ` is a physical (gauge-invariant)
observable as soon as `μ` is right invariant (`gaugeAverage_isPhysicalObservable`),
it is normalized on the constants when `μ` is a probability measure
(`gaugeAverage_const`), and it fixes the observables that are already physical
(`gaugeAverage_of_isPhysicalObservable`) — so averaging is a projection onto the
physical algebra, and the "constrained spectrum" of gauge-invariant functionals is
never empty.  The same three facts are proved for a finite gauge group with the
normalized counting average (`finiteGaugeAverage_*`), where no integrability
hypothesis at all is needed.

Between the two, `isPhysicalObservable_of_tendsto` records the manuscript's remark
that a *gauge* symmetry can never be anomalous (`book.tex` 2389–2395): gauge
invariance of the observables survives every limit, so no symmetry-breaking
parameter can destroy it.

## 3. The pushforward implements the exact constraint without a null set
(`book.tex` 2228–2238 and 2369–2376)

> "there is still the possibility of defining the probability measure of the
> constrained space as a pushforward measure from the unconstrained to the
> constrained space" … "Then, the pushforward measure using such measurable
> function implements the exact constraints in a separable probability space
> without attributing to the constrained space null probability measure."

`map_measure_constrainedSet` : for a measurable projection `q` of the spectrum
into the constrained set `C`, the pushforward `μ.map q` gives `C` probability one
— the exact constraint holds almost surely, and the constrained space carries the
whole measure instead of being null.  `integral_map_of_invariant` : expectation
values of the observables that do not see the projection (in particular the
physical ones, when the projection moves a point only inside its gauge
equivalence class) are unchanged by the pushforward.

Everything in this module is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
