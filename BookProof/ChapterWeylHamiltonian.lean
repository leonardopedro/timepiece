# Chapter "Timepiece and the Gribov ambiguity", §"Renormalization, the mass gap and the Millennium prize"

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Timepiece and the Gribov ambiguity"*,
§*"Free electromagnetic field: an exact example"* / §*"Renormalization, the mass
gap and the Millennium prize"* (lines ~7480–7520), and the parallel Weyl-gauge
Hamiltonian in the chapter *"Quantization due to time-evolution: Yang-Mills and
Classical Statistical Field Theory"*, §*"Pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory"*
(line ~7060).

The book reduces the Yang–Mills Hamiltonian, after BRST gauge fixing, to the
**Weyl-gauge Hamiltonian density**

  `H_W(x) = ½ πⁱₐ πⁱₐ + ½ Bᵢₐ Bᵢₐ`

(a sum of squares of the *self-adjoint* electric-field operators `πⁱₐ` and
magnetic-field operators `Bᵢₐ`; the sign is a convention of the classical
action). The central claim used in the mass-gap discussion is:

> "We can easily conclude that the Hamiltonian in the Weyl gauge is **positive
> definite** and thus … Yang-Mills theory can be reformulated with or without a
> mass gap without any observable consequences."

Positive-definiteness (bounded below by `0`) is exactly what makes the mass-gap
argument of §"Mass gap" applicable, so this file formalizes that self-contained
mathematical fact.

## What is proved

Work on an arbitrary complex Hilbert space `H` (the physical state space).
Model the electric-field operators `π : Fin n → H →L[ℂ] H` and the
magnetic-field operators `B : Fin m → H →L[ℂ] H` as bounded **self-adjoint**
operators (`IsSelfAdjoint`, the physical requirement that they are observables).
Define the Weyl-gauge Hamiltonian

  `weylHamiltonian π B = ½ • (∑ i, (π i)² ) + ½ • (∑ a, (B a)² )`.

* `selfAdjoint_sq_isPositive` — the square of a self-adjoint operator is a
  positive operator (its expectation values are `≥ 0`).
* `smul_nonneg_isPositive` — a nonnegative real multiple of a positive operator
  is positive.
* `weylHamiltonian_isPositive` — **the Weyl-gauge Hamiltonian is a positive
  operator** (`(weylHamiltonian π B).IsPositive`); this is the book's
  "positive definite" statement.
* `weylHamiltonian_expectation_nonneg` — every expectation value is `≥ 0`
  (`0 ≤ re ⟪weylHamiltonian π B x, x⟫`), the operational form of
  "positive definite" / "bounded below by `0`".
* `weylHamiltonian_isSelfAdjoint` — the Weyl-gauge Hamiltonian is itself
  self-adjoint (a genuine observable).
