# `dΓ(A)` for a Schur-class one-particle matrix: the number bound and essential
# self-adjointness on the finite-occupation core

`BookProof.ChapterFockDifferingBasesEsa` proves essential self-adjointness of a second
quantized Hamiltonian under the **unweighted `ℓ¹` gate** `∑ₖ ‖gₖ‖ < ∞` on its matrix
elements — a genuine restriction: a one-particle operator as simple as the
nearest-neighbour hopping `A_{jk} = 1` for `|j − k| = 1` has infinitely many entries of
modulus one and is not covered.

The gate that the physics actually asks for is the **Schur bound**

```text
∀ k, ∑_j |⟪e_j, A e_k⟫| ≤ K,
```

the classical criterion for boundedness of the one-particle operator `A`.  This module
proves that under that gate alone the second quantization `dΓ(A)` of
`BookProof.ChapterFockSecondQuantization` obeys the **number bound**

```text
‖dΓ(A) u‖ ≤ K ‖𝒩 u‖
```

on the finite-occupation core, that it **conserves the particle number** exactly, and
that it is therefore essentially self-adjoint there — with no diagonalizing basis and no
summability of the entries.

## What is proved

* `ndeg`, `numSym`, `InSector` — the particle number of a configuration, the comparison
  symbol `σ(α) = |α| + 1` and the sectors of the Fock space.
* `annA_inSector`, `creA_inSector`, `dGamma_inSector` — the ladder operators shift the
  sector by one, so `dΓ(A)` **preserves** it: second quantization conserves the particle
  number.
* `sum_normSq_annA` — `∑ₖ ‖a_k u‖² = ⟪u, 𝒩u⟫`, the identity behind the number bound.
* `schur_test` — the elementary (finite) Schur test `∑_{k,j} |A_{kj}| x_k y_j ≤ K‖x‖‖y‖`.
* **`norm_dGamma_le_of_sector`** — on the `n`-particle sector, `‖dΓ(A)u‖ ≤ K n ‖u‖`.
* **`norm_dGamma_le`** — hence `‖dΓ(A)u‖ ≤ K‖𝒩u‖` on the whole core, by orthogonality of
  the sectors.
* **`dGamma_essentiallySelfAdjointOn_core`** — the headline: for a Hermitian
  column-finite matrix with a Schur bound, `dΓ(A)` is essentially self-adjoint on the
  finite-occupation core, through
  `BookProof.CoreBounds.essentiallySelfAdjointOn_finiteModes_of_core_bounds_comm`.
* `dGamma_stone_flow`, `dGamma_positiveExtension_eq_closure` — the unique self-adjoint
  realization, its unitary group (Stone), and — for a positive matrix — the identification
  of the Friedrichs extension with the closure.
* `hopCol`, `isHermCol_hopCol`, `schurBound_hopCol`, `hopCol_not_summable`,
  **`hop_essentiallySelfAdjointOn_core`** — non-vacuity: the nearest-neighbour hopping
  matrix satisfies the Schur gate with `K = 2` while its entries are *not* summable, so
  the statement is strictly outside the `ℓ¹` gate of `ChapterFockDifferingBasesEsa`.

## Honest boundary

The one-particle matrix must be **column-finite** (each `A e_k` a finite combination of
basis states) — that is what makes `dΓ(A)` map the finite-occupation core into itself —
and Hermitian, and it must satisfy the Schur bound, which forces `A` itself to be
*bounded*.  Nothing here covers an unbounded one-particle operator: for those the number
operator is not a comparison operator and `dΓ` needs a different gate.

Everything in this module is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
