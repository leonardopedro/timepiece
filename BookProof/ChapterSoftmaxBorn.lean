# Chapter "The Coherent State of Attention", §"Softmax Is the Born Rule on
Coherent States" — the headline identity

Formalization of the headline claim of the new chapter `Book/CoherentState.lean`
(adapted from `coherent.md`): applying the **Born rule** (normalized squared
modulus) to the coherent-state overlaps of a query `q` against a family of keys
`k : Fin m → ℝⁿ` produces **exactly the Softmax attention weights** at inverse
temperature `2`, provided the keys have a common norm (LayerNorm / RMSNorm).

The mathematical content is a finite `Finset` identity.  Writing
`⟨q|k_j⟩ = exp (-‖q‖²/2 - ‖k_j‖²/2 + ⟪q,k_j⟫)` (`ChapterCoherentOverlap`), the
Born numerator splits into three factors

  `|⟨q|k_j⟩|² = exp (-‖q‖²) · exp (-‖k_j‖²) · exp (2⟪q,k_j⟫)`,

of which the first is independent of `j` and cancels between numerator and
denominator, and the second is *also* independent of `j` once the keys are
normalized, and cancels too.  What is left is Softmax.

Deliverables (all `sorry`-free, `axiom`-free):

* `bornWeight` — the Born-rule attention weight built from coherent overlaps;
* `softmax` — the usual Softmax attention weight at inverse temperature `beta`;
* `coherentBorn_sq_eq` — **the three-factor split** of `|⟨q|k⟩|²`;
* `bornWeight_nonneg`, `bornWeight_pos`, `bornWeight_sum_one` — the Born weights
  are a genuine probability distribution over the keys;
* `softmax_nonneg`, `softmax_pos`, `softmax_sum_one` — likewise for Softmax;
* `coherentBorn_cancel_q` — the `exp (-‖q‖²)` factor cancels: the Born weight is
  already independent of the query norm;
* **HEADLINE `coherentBorn_eq_softmax`** — under a constant key norm, the Born
  rule on coherent states *is* Softmax attention at inverse temperature `2`
  (equivalently temperature `τ = 1/2`);
* `coherentBorn_eq_softmax_of_unit_keys` — the LayerNorm special case `‖k_j‖ = 1`.

**Recorded disparity with the informal chapter.**  The chapter states the overlap
for general (complex) Bargmann parameters; the theorems here are proved for
*real* parameters, where the overlap is a positive real.  The complex case adds
only a phase `exp (i · Im ⟪q,k⟫)`, which the Born rule (squared modulus) discards,
so the weight formula is unchanged; but that extension is not formalized here.
The chapter's informal step "each `exp(-‖k_j‖²)` is a fixed constant" is a genuine
hypothesis, and appears as the explicit assumption `∀ l, ‖k l‖ = r`.

Everything here is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).
