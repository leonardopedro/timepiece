# Gauge symmetry defined by a *comprehensive but incomplete* gauge fixing

This module formalizes the section *"Gauge transformations, constrained systems
and conditioned probability"* of `book.tex` (lines 2221–2400), and specifically
the argument by which a gauge symmetry can be **defined** at all:

> "Note that it is a subalgebra of the commutative von Neumann algebra that is
> gauge-invariant and not the Hilbert space." (`book.tex` 2260)

> "If we consider instead a commutative von Neumann algebra and its spectrum,
> such that any non-trivial gauge transformation necessarily modifies any point
> of the spectrum while conserving the commutative von Neumann algebra […] then
> such commutative von Neumann algebra is one example of an incomplete
> unconstrained gauge-fixing. […] Such commutative algebra has the crucial
> advantage that the gauge generators are necessarily excluded from the algebra,
> so that it can be used to define a separable Hilbert space compatible with the
> gauge group because the expectation value of any operator of the commutative
> algebra which commutes with the gauge generators is the same at each
> equivalence class." (`book.tex` 2329–2348)

The book's two axes of classification of a gauge fixing are used here with the
book's own vocabulary (`book.tex` 2294–2299, 7406, 7427):

* *comprehensive* — the gauge fixing crosses **at least** once each gauge
  equivalence class (`IsComprehensiveGaugeFixing`);
* *complete* — it crosses **at most** once each class, i.e. there is no remnant
  gauge symmetry (`IsCompleteGaugeFixing'`); the gauge fixing used in the book is
  deliberately **incomplete**;
* *unconstrained* — the gauge generators are excluded from the commutative
  algebra, which here is the condition that every non-trivial gauge
  transformation moves **every** point of the spectrum
  (`MovesEveryPointOfSpectrum`).

The content proved below is:

1. **Spectrum layer.** The full spectrum is a comprehensive gauge fixing
   (`univ_isComprehensiveGaugeFixing`); if every non-trivial gauge transformation
   moves every point (unconstrained), this gauge fixing is necessarily
   *incomplete* (`unconstrained_gauge_fixing_incomplete`), its remnant symmetry
   is a *faithful* representation of the gauge group (`remnant_faithful`), and no
   point of the spectrum is gauge invariant (`no_gauge_invariant_point`).
2. **The physical algebra is nevertheless complete.** Gauge-invariant
   ("physical") observables form a subalgebra (`physicalSubalgebra`), they are
   exactly the functions of the gauge equivalence class
   (`isPhysicalObservable_iff_factors`), two of them that agree on a
   comprehensive gauge fixing are equal (`physical_ext_of_comprehensive`), and
   *every* remnant-invariant observable of a comprehensive gauge fixing is the
   restriction of a physical observable (`exists_physical_extension`). So passing
   to a comprehensive but incomplete gauge fixing loses no physical information.
3. **Hilbert-space layer.** For a unitary representation of the gauge group, the
   physical operators are the commutant (`isPhysicalOperator_iff_mem_centralizer`),
   and their expectation values are the same at every vector of a gauge
   equivalence class (`expectation_physical_gauge_invariant`) — even when no
   vector of the Hilbert space is gauge invariant
   (`no_gauge_invariant_unit_vector_of_free`).
4. **The book's own example** (`book.tex` 2281–2289) — the lattice translations
   `e_k ↦ e_{k+1}` on `ℓ²(ℤ)` — is carried by the companion module
   `BookProof.ChapterGaugeShiftExample`, which is kept independent of this one so
   that the two threads of the development stay separately compilable.

A by-product recorded here: the auxiliary predicate
`ChapterG.IsUnconstrainedGaugeFixing` is unsatisfiable as stated
(`chapterG_isUnconstrainedGaugeFixing_vacuous`), which is why the notion is
re-formalized in this module as a property of the action on the spectrum rather
than of the invariant algebra.  This is a defect of that one predicate only: the
book's *definition* of an unconstrained gauge-fixing is satisfiable, and is
formalized, satisfied and shown to leave the full spectrum unconstrained in
`BookProof.ChapterGaugeUnconstrainedSpectrum`.

Everything is `sorry`-free.

/-! ## 3. A correction to an earlier predicate

`ChapterG.IsUnconstrainedGaugeFixing π` asks for a *gauge-invariant* function `f`
and a gauge transformation `g` with `f ∘ g ≠ f`, which contradicts invariance of
`f`: that predicate is unsatisfiable, so every statement conditioned on it is
vacuous. This says nothing against the book's definition, which is satisfiable:
the unconstrained condition of the book is the exclusion of the gauge generators
from the commutative algebra — so that they impose no constraint on the full
spectrum labelled by the basis vectors — formalized in
`BookProof.ChapterGaugeUnconstrainedSpectrum`, and equivalently rendered here as
the condition `MovesEveryPointOfSpectrum` on the action on the spectrum. -/
