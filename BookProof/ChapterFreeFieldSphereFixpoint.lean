# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §5 —
# the Gaussian-built uniform sphere measure is a fixed point of re-normalization

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Wave-function parametrization of a probability
measure"*, section *"5. Free field parametrization in Bayesian inference and
Statistical Mechanics"* (`book.tex` line ~1706):

> "it is well known since many decades that a uniform (Lebesgue-like) measure of
> an infinite-dimensional sphere can be defined using the Gaussian measure and
> the Fock-space."

`ChapterFreeFieldSphere` defined `sphereGaussian`, the pushforward of the
standard Gaussian prior under radial normalization `x ↦ ‖x‖⁻¹ • x`, and
`ChapterFreeFieldSphereSupport` proved (for `n ≥ 1`) that the resulting measure
lives on the unit sphere.  This file records the natural companion fact that
makes precise "the construction produces a measure *on the sphere*": the sphere
measure is a **fixed point of the normalization pushforward**.  Since the
Gaussian assigns no mass to the origin, radial normalization is idempotent
almost everywhere, so pushing `sphereGaussian` forward again by `normalize`
returns `sphereGaussian` unchanged.

## Main results

* `normalize_normalize` — radial normalization is idempotent off the origin:
  for `x ≠ 0`, `normalize (normalize x) = normalize x`.
* **headline** `sphereGaussian_map_normalize` — for `n ≥ 1`,
  `(sphereGaussian n).map normalize = sphereGaussian n`: the Gaussian-built
  uniform sphere measure is a fixed point of re-normalization.

Everything is intended to be `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.

**Headline.** For `n ≥ 1` the Gaussian-built uniform sphere measure is a fixed
point of the normalization pushforward: pushing `sphereGaussian n` forward again
by radial normalization returns it unchanged.  This is because the standard
Gaussian is atomless at the origin (`stdGaussian_singleton`), so `normalize` is
idempotent almost everywhere (`normalize_normalize`).
