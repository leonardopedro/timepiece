# Chapter "The Coherent State of Attention", §"The Geometry of the Wave-packet" —
the coherent-state overlap is the Gaussian reproducing kernel

Formalization of the first identity of the new chapter `Book/CoherentState.lean`
(adapted from `coherent.md`).  Each query/key vector `q, k` is the parameter of a
*coherent state* `|q⟩, |k⟩` of a bosonic mode; the Bargmann–Fock reproducing
kernel gives the overlap

  `⟨q | k⟩ = exp (-‖q‖²/2 - ‖k‖²/2 + ⟪q, k⟫)`.

This module works over `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (the *real* coherent-state
parameters, where the overlap is a positive real number — the general complex
Bargmann kernel carries an extra phase `exp (i · Im ⟪q,k⟫)` which is invisible to
the Born rule of the next chapter section).

Deliverables (all `sorry`-free, `axiom`-free):

* `coherentOverlap` — the overlap, as a real-valued function of two vectors;
* `coherentOverlap_eq` — the explicit coordinate (sum) formula;
* `coherentOverlap_eq_gaussian` — **the reproducing kernel is a Gaussian**:
  `⟨q|k⟩ = exp (-‖q - k‖²/2)`; the "baseline" terms `-‖q‖²/2, -‖k‖²/2` and the
  alignment term `⟪q,k⟫` recombine into (minus one half) the squared distance;
* `coherentOverlap_pos`, `coherentOverlap_le_one` — the overlap is a positive
  real number, never exceeding `1`;
* `coherentOverlap_self`, `coherentOverlap_unit` — a coherent state is
  normalized: `⟨q|q⟩ = 1`, in particular for a unit vector;
* `coherentOverlap_comm` — symmetry of the kernel;
* `coherentOverlap_eq_one_iff` — the overlap saturates exactly on the diagonal.

Everything here is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

/-- The **coherent-state overlap** of two real coherent-state parameters,
i.e. the Bargmann–Fock reproducing kernel evaluated at `(q, k)`:

/-- **The coherent overlap is the Gaussian reproducing kernel.**  The two
"baseline" penalties `-‖q‖²/2`, `-‖k‖²/2` and the alignment reward `⟪q,k⟫`
recombine into minus one half the squared distance, so the Bargmann–Fock kernel
on real parameters *is* the Gaussian kernel. -/
