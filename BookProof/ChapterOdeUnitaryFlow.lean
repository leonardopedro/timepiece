# The unitary time-evolution of the blow-up ODE `ẋ = x²`

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Resolution of the singularity of the ODE x'=x^2 when the
initial x has uncertainties"*, §*State-of-the-art* (Equation 1) and §*Resolution of the
singularity using the uncertainties in x* (Equations 2–4).

The chapter's computation is the following.  The classical initial-value problem

```
ẋ = x²,   x(0) = x₀
```

has the solution `x(t) = x₀ / (1 - t x₀)` (Equation 1), which **blows up** at the finite
time `t = 1/x₀` when `x₀ > 0`: there is no global deterministic solution.  The book then
quantizes the vector field, `H = x² p - i x`, diagonalizes `H` by the kernel
`U(x,p) = e^{-i p / x} / (√(2π) x)` and evaluates the resulting time-evolution kernel,
obtaining (Equation 3)

```
(e^{-i H t} ψ)(x) = 1/(x t + 1) · ψ( x / (x t + 1) )
```

and, for a multiplication operator `ρ` (a probability density in the `x`-basis),
(Equation 4)

```
(e^{-i H t} ρ e^{+i H t} ψ)(x) = ρ( x / (x t + 1) ) · ψ(x) .
```

This file formalizes that computation *as an independent mathematical statement*: we
**define** the operator family of Equation 3 and prove that it is what the book claims it
is — a one-parameter group of **probability-preserving** operators on `L²(ℝ)` whose
generator is exactly `-i H`, and which conjugates a multiplication operator as in
Equation 4.  Nothing here presupposes the (merely formal) manipulations with the
δ-function kernel of the source text; the point of the formalization is that the *result*
of those manipulations is correct, and that it does resolve the singularity at the level
of probability measures: **for every real time `t`, including times beyond the classical
blow-up, total probability is exactly conserved** (`odeKoop_lintegral_normSq`).

The mechanism is visible in the formulas.  The flow map

```
mob t x = x / (1 + t x)
```

is a Möbius map which is *not* defined at the single point `x = -1/t`, and which maps
`ℝ \ {-1/t}` bijectively onto `ℝ \ {1/t}`.  A single point is a Lebesgue-null set, so as a
transformation of the *probability space* the flow is a bijection up to null sets: what
"escapes to `+∞`" re-enters at `-∞`.  The pointwise trajectory of a single initial
condition still blows up (`classicalSol_tendsto_atTop`), but the evolution of the
uncertainty — the wave-function — is global and norm-preserving.

## Main results

* `classicalSol_hasDerivAt`, `classicalSol_zero` — Equation 1 solves `ẋ = x²`.
* `classicalSol_tendsto_atTop` — and blows up at `t = 1/x₀` for `x₀ > 0`.
* `mob_mob`, `mob_zero`, `mob_neg_mob` — the Möbius flow is a group action off the pole.
* `odeKoop_add`, `odeKoop_zero` — Equation 3 defines a one-parameter group.
* `odeKoop_lintegral_normSq` — **probability conservation for every `t`** (the `L²`
  isometry; the headline).
* `odeKoop_conj_mul` — Equation 4: conjugation of a multiplication operator.
* `hasDerivAt_odeKoop_zero`, `odeKoop_generator` — the generator of the group is `-i H`
  with `H = x² p - i x`, `p = -i ∂ₓ`: Equation 3 solves the Schrödinger equation of the
  quantized vector field.

/-! ## The change of variables `w = -1/x`: the evolution *is* a translation

The chapter observes that *"the Hamiltonian differs from the translation in space by a
change of variables `y → 1/x`"*.  We prove exactly that: the unitary change of variables
`W` induced by `x ↦ -1/x` intertwines the evolution of Equation 3 with the translation
group, `e^{-iHt} ∘ W = W ∘ T_t`.  This is the structural reason for the group law and for
the conservation of probability: on the `w`-chart the singular flow is just `w ↦ w - t`.
