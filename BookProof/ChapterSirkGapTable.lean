# Chapter SirkGapTable — the per-coupling certified gap table and Richardson extrapolation
(T11, T12)

`CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` §13.7 (T11 and T12).  T6 (`ChapterSirkCertifiedGap`) turns one
emitted certificate into a lower bound for the parity gap of the truncated Hamiltonian.
Two things are still wanted around it:

* **T11** — a *table*: one certified row per coupling constant `g`, each row a T6
  instantiation, together with the comparison against the analytic strong-coupling
  value `g²/2`;
* **T12** — the finite-size → thermodynamic-limit **Richardson extrapolation**, stated
  as the conditional theorem the plan asks for ("if the finite-size correction is
  `O(l^{-p})` for a known `p`, then the extrapolated gap is …").

## Honest boundary

* Every certified statement is about the **truncated** operator `H_m(g)` at the given
  coupling; the continuum passage is the standing boundary of §13 and is not used.
* The rows of the table are *conditional*: a row proves what it proves given the two
  (or, for the two-sided version, four) enclosures the certificate for that coupling
  asserts.  The repository records the aggregates of exactly one solve — the `g = 2`,
  `m = 4` run — so exactly one row is instantiated with data; the rest of the table is
  the general statement, ready to be instantiated when further certificates are emitted.
* The Richardson section proves an *algebraic identity and its error propagation*.  The
  numerical values it is evaluated on are transcribed data, and the extrapolated number
  is a numerical estimate, not a certified bound: nothing here claims the
  thermodynamic-limit gap.

## Deliverables

* `gap_le_of_certificate` — the upper half of T6, so a certificate with two-sided
  enclosures gives a genuine *enclosure* `certified_gap_mem_interval` of the sector gap.
* `CouplingCertificate`, `CouplingCertificate.lo/hi`, **T11** `certified_gap_table`
  (every row of a table of certificates bounds the gap of its own operator from below)
  and `certified_gap_table_interval` (the two-sided form).
* `strongCoupling`, `strongCoupling_lt` and `strongCoupling_mem_of_certificate` — the
  analytic `g²/2` prediction, its strict monotonicity in the coupling, and the
  per-row consistency check; `qcdG2M4_row`, `qcdG2M4_row_lo`,
  `qcdG2M4_strongCoupling_consistent` — the one recorded row, whose certified window
  `[1.932, 2.043]` does contain the analytic value `g²/2 = 2` at `g = 2`.
* **T12** `richardson`, `richardson_exact` (the extrapolation is exact for a pure
  `C·l^{-p}` correction), `richardson_error` (its error propagation), and
  `richardson_qym_g4` — the evaluation on the recorded finite-size data.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.

/-! ## 4. T12 — Richardson extrapolation of the finite-size gaps

The plan writes the extrapolation as `Δ(∞) ≈ Δ(l₂) + (Δ(l₂) − Δ(l₁))/((l₁/l₂)^p − 1)`.
With `l₁ < l₂` that ratio is the wrong way round — the correction then *adds* the tail
instead of cancelling it — so the definition below uses `(l₂/l₁)^p − 1`, which is what
makes the extrapolation exact (`richardson_exact`). -/
