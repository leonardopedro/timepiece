# The converse of Mackey's imprimitivity theorem over a continuous base

`BookProof.ChapterMackeyQuasiInvariant` proves the **induced direction** over a
measure-theoretic base: a quasi-invariant measure and a measurable unitary cocycle give a
system of imprimitivity on `L²(X, μ; K)`.  The converse — every system of imprimitivity
over such a base is unitarily equivalent to an induced one — was formalized only for a
**discrete** base (`BookProof.ChapterMackeyGeneralBase`).  This file proves the converse
over a continuous base, for a system with a **cyclic** vector (the multiplicity-one case,
to which the general case reduces by decomposing into cyclic subspaces).

## Statement

A *continuous-base system of imprimitivity* is a unitary representation `U` of `G` on `H`
together with a projection-valued measure `P` on the measurable `G`-space `X` obeying
Mackey's covariance relation `U(g) P(E) = P(g·E) U(g)`.  If `ψ` is a cyclic vector for `P`
and `μ = ‖P(·)ψ‖²` is the measure it defines, then

* `μ` is **quasi-invariant** (`QuasiInvariant μ G`) — this is forced, not assumed;
* there is a unitary `W : L²(X, μ) ≃ H` carrying the projection-valued measure to
  multiplication by indicators, and
* a measurable cocycle `u : G → X → ℂ` of **modulus one** with
  `W⁻¹ U(g) W f (x) = u g x · √(dens μ g x) · f(g⁻¹ x)` a.e.,

i.e. the system is unitarily equivalent to the induced system of
`BookProof.ChapterMackeyQuasiInvariant` built from `μ` and `u`.

Everything is `sorry`-free and uses only the standard axioms.
