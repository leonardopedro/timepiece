# The canonical pairs behind the many-mode Navier–Stokes Hamiltonian

`BookProof.ChapterNavierStokesFockManyMode` proves the two Faris–Lavine
inequalities for a concrete operator `fockH` on the Fock space `ℓ²(ℕᵈ)` of a
`d`-mode field, and for the diagonal comparison operator `diagMax (fockSym κ)`.
This module verifies that these two operators really *are* the Navier–Stokes
objects they are advertised to be:

* `Ĥ = ∑ᵢ ½(πᵢ Vᵢ + Vᵢ πᵢ)`, the symmetrised transport operator of the field, and
* `N̂ = ∑ᵢ (πᵢ² + Vᵢ²) + I`, the comparison operator built from the squares of the
  individual non-commuting pieces,

for the canonical pairs `πᵢ = -i ∂/∂uᵢ`, `uᵢ` of the modes and the *linear*
advection fields `Vᵢ(u) = κᵢ uᵢ`.  Everything is checked on the
finite-configuration core `lpFiniteModes (Occ d)`.

## Contents

* `ann i`, `cre i` — the annihilation and creation operators of the mode `i`,
  with `[aᵢ, aᵢ†] = I` (`comm_ann_cre`);
* `mom κ i`, `pos κ i`, `drift κ i` — the momentum `πᵢ`, the fiber coordinate
  `uᵢ` and the advection field `Vᵢ = κᵢ uᵢ`;
* `comm_mom_pos` — **`[πᵢ, uᵢ] = -i`**;
* `fock_comparison_eq` — **`∑ᵢ(πᵢ² + Vᵢ²) + I = N̂`**;
* `fock_hamiltonian_eq` — **`∑ᵢ ½(πᵢVᵢ + Vᵢπᵢ) = Ĥ`**;
* `fock_canonical_essentiallySelfAdjointOn_core` — hence the canonically written
  many-mode Navier–Stokes Hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint on the
  finite-configuration core.
