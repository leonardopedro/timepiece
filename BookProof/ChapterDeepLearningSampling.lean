# Book chapter "Aligned deep learning as a random sampling method"

This file formalizes the finite mathematical core of §§3–5 of the chapter at
`book.tex` lines 9855–10155.  A randomized training procedure is represented by
a deterministic map from random seeds to models.  Pushing the seed distribution
forward gives the emergent prior on trained models.  Conditioning this prior by
a nonnegative likelihood gives the usual Bayesian posterior.

The statements here do not formalize the chapter's empirical claims about actual
neural networks.  They isolate the exact probability identities those claims use.
