# The Faris–Lavine commutator criterion for essential self-adjointness

This module formalizes and **proves** the abstract theorem of

> W. G. Faris and R. B. Lavine, *Commutators and self-adjointness of Hamiltonian
> operators*, Commun. Math. Phys. **35** (1974), 39–48, Theorem 1,

which elsewhere in this project (`BookProof.ChapterNavierStokesFlow`) had to be
carried as a named hypothesis.  The statement of the paper is:

> Let `H` be a Hermitian operator and `N ≥ 0` a positive self-adjoint operator
> with (i) `𝒟(N) ⊆ 𝒟(H)` and (ii) `± i[H, N] ≤ c N` for some `c < ∞`.  Then `H`
> is essentially self-adjoint.

## How the statement is rendered here

* The Hilbert space is a complex inner-product space `F` which is complete.
* `H` and `N` are linear maps `D →ₗ[ℂ] F` on a common domain `D`, which plays the
  role of `𝒟(N)`; hypothesis (i) of the paper is built into this — `H` is defined
  wherever `N` is.  (The conclusion is about the restriction of `H` to `𝒟(N)`,
  which by the last remark of §2 of the paper is the stronger statement: any
  symmetric extension of an essentially self-adjoint operator has the same
  closure.)
* Symmetry is `SymmetricOn`, the quadratic form of `N` is `quadForm`, and
  `commForm H N x = ⟪x, i[H, N] x⟫` is the commutator form; that this is a real
  number is `commForm_eq`.  Hypothesis (ii) is `|commForm H N x| ≤ c * quadForm N x`,
  which is exactly the two-sided bound `± i[H, N] ≤ c N` of the paper.
* Essential self-adjointness is rendered, as everywhere in this project, by the
  vanishing of the deficiency spaces of the adjoint: `EssentiallySelfAdjointOn D H`
  says that no `w ≠ 0` satisfies `⟪H v, w⟫ = ⟪v, ± i w⟫` for all `v ∈ D`.
* Self-adjointness of `N` is used in the paper at exactly one place: it makes
  `N + 1` a bijection of `𝒟(N)` onto the whole space, so that `(N+1)⁻¹ f` is an
  admissible test vector.  That consequence — surjectivity of `N + 1` — is what
  is assumed here (`hNsurj`), so no spectral theory for unbounded operators is
  needed and the criterion applies verbatim to any `N` for which `-1` is in the
  resolvent set.

## Contents

* `deficiencyTrivialAt_of_farisLavine` — the computation of the paper: under the
  Faris–Lavine hypotheses the deficiency space at `d i` vanishes whenever
  `2|d| > c`.  This is the displayed inequality `± 2 d ⟪f, N⁻¹f⟫ ≤ c ⟪f, N⁻¹f⟫`
  of the original proof.
* `exists_weak_graph_limit` — the closure of a symmetric operator with dense
  range of `H - d i` hits every vector: given `y`, there are `u, z` in the closure
  of the graph with `z - d i u = y`.  Proved by hand from the identity
  `‖H x - d i x‖² = ‖H x‖² + d²‖x‖²`, which makes the approximating sequence and
  its image Cauchy.
* `deficiencyTrivialAt_of_dense_range` — the classical basic criterion: for a
  symmetric operator, vanishing of the deficiency spaces at one conjugate pair
  `± d i` (`d ≠ 0`) forces vanishing at *every* non-real point.  This is the step
  that upgrades the paper's "for `|d|` large" to essential self-adjointness.
* `essentiallySelfAdjointOn_of_farisLavine` — **Theorem 1 of Faris–Lavine.**
* `hasZeroDeficiencyOn_of_farisLavine` — the same conclusion in the predicate
  `BookProof.NavierStokesFlow.HasZeroDeficiencyOn` used by the Navier–Stokes
  chapters, for an operator that leaves its domain invariant.
* `not_farisLavine_criterion_of_relative_bound` — a caveat, and the reason the
  hypotheses above are what they are: the *unrestricted* form of the criterion
  (relative bound `‖Hv‖ ≤ a‖Nv‖` plus commutator bound, with no positivity and no
  self-adjointness required of `N`) is **false**; taking `N = H` for the
  limit-circle Jacobi operator of `BookProof.ChapterNavierStokesDeficiency`
  satisfies both inequalities while essential self-adjointness fails.
* `essentiallySelfAdjointOn_of_bounded_symmetric` and
  `multiplication_essentiallySelfAdjoint` — the hypotheses are satisfiable: the
  first in the everywhere-defined case, the second for the (unbounded)
  multiplication operator by an arbitrary real sequence on its maximal domain in
  `ℓ²(ℕ)`.

Nothing here is assumed: the module contains no `axiom`, and every result is
proved from Mathlib.
