# Comprehensive gauge fixings: existence, uniqueness of the extension, and the
Gribov obstruction

This module continues the formalization of the section *"Gauge transformations,
constrained systems and conditioned probability"* of `book.tex` (lines 2221–2400).
The companion module `BookProof.ChapterGaugeIncompleteFixing` sets up the book's
vocabulary — a gauge fixing is a subset `S` of the spectrum of the commutative von
Neumann algebra, it is *comprehensive* when it crosses at least once each gauge
equivalence class, *complete* when it crosses at most once each class, and
*unconstrained* when every non-trivial gauge transformation moves every point of
the spectrum — and proves that a comprehensive gauge fixing loses no physical
information.  What is added here is the *existence* theory and the obstruction the
book attributes to the Gribov ambiguity:

> "The Dirac brackets require the gauge-fixing to be both unconstrained and
> complete (as if the gauge symmetry could be eliminated), which is not possible
> in general due to the Gribov ambiguity." (`book.tex` 2301–2304)

## Results

* `orbitRepresentatives_isComprehensiveGaugeFixing`,
  `orbitRepresentatives_isCompleteGaugeFixing'`,
  `exists_comprehensive_complete_gaugeFixing` — a gauge fixing which is
  simultaneously comprehensive and complete always exists *as a set*: the set of
  representatives of the gauge equivalence classes.  So the obstruction below is
  not a set-theoretic one.
* `existsUnique_mem_of_complete_comprehensive` — on such a gauge fixing each point
  of the spectrum has exactly one gauge representative, and
  `exists_physical_extension_of_complete`,
  `existsUnique_physical_extension_of_complete` — *every* function on it is the
  restriction of exactly one gauge-invariant (physical) observable: a complete
  comprehensive gauge fixing is a faithful parametrization of the physical
  algebra.
* `not_isPhysicalObservable_indicator` — nevertheless the gauge-fixing condition
  itself is never a physical observable when the gauge group acts freely: the
  gauge fixing is extra data, not an observable.
* `not_isClopen_of_complete_comprehensive` — **the obstruction.**  If the spectrum
  is connected and the gauge group acts freely and non-trivially, a complete
  comprehensive gauge fixing is never clopen, i.e. it can never be cut out by a
  locally constant (continuous) gauge condition.  Completeness can be achieved
  only by a discontinuous choice.
* The book's simplest concrete instance, `ℤ` acting on the line by translations
  (`shiftAction`): the unit cell `[0,1)` is a complete comprehensive gauge fixing
  (`unitCell_isComprehensiveGaugeFixing`, `unitCell_isCompleteGaugeFixing'`),
  the action is unconstrained in the book's sense
  (`shift_movesEveryPointOfSpectrum`), and no complete comprehensive gauge fixing
  of this action is clopen (`shift_no_clopen_complete_gaugeFixing`) — an explicit
  Gribov-type ambiguity.
* `physical_ext_iff_comprehensive`, `physical_extension_iff_complete` — the two
  axes of the book's classification are **exactly** the two halves of the
  statement that restriction to the gauge-fixing surface is a bijection from the
  physical algebra onto the functions of the surface: comprehensiveness is
  injectivity (no physical information is lost), completeness is surjectivity (no
  remnant symmetry constrains the surface).
* `spuriousSection_isComprehensiveGaugeFixing`,
  `spuriousSection_isCompleteGaugeFixing'` — the manuscript's device of adjoining
  a *spurious* field with a constraint (`book.tex` 7406) does produce a gauge
  fixing that is at once complete and comprehensive, for an arbitrary gauge
  group: the spurious factor is a copy of the gauge group, fixed to the
  identity.
* `shift_gaugeFixing_classification` — all four combinations of the two axes
  occur, with explicit witnesses for the translation gauge symmetry of the line;
  the book uses a *complete non-comprehensive* fixing (the magnetic components in
  the Weyl gauge, `book.tex` 7427) as well as *complete and comprehensive* ones
  (`book.tex` 7406) and the incomplete unconstrained one of `book.tex` 2336.

Everything in this module is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free.
