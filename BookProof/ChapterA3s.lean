# Chapter A, §A.3 — Note 50 / Lemma 52: dimensions of the complete-reducibility
summands at `N = 3` (the first case with a nonzero mixed-symmetry piece)

Source: `book.tex` §A.3, Note 50 (Weyl complete reducibility) and Lemma 52.

`ChapterA3r` computed the ranks (traces) of the complete-reducibility projectors
`{projSym N, projAnti N, projMixed N}` in the base case `N = 2`, where the mixed
piece vanishes.  This file takes the next case `N = 3` — the **first** where the
symmetric and antisymmetric pieces no longer exhaust `V^{⊗3}` and the
mixed-symmetry summand is nonzero.

Each projector is idempotent, so its trace equals its rank (the dimension of the
summand).  For the `4`-dimensional Dirac spinor `V` (`dim V^{⊗3} = 4³ = 64`) the
counts are

  `dim Sym³V = 20`,   `dim Λ³V = 4`,   `dim(mixed) = 40`,   `20 + 4 + 40 = 64`.

Concretely `tr (projSym 3) = (3!)⁻¹ Σ_{σ∈S₃} tr(permMat σ)`, where by
`ChapterA3r.trace_permMat` each `tr(permMat σ)` counts the tuples fixed by `σ`,
i.e. `4^{(number of cycles of σ)}`:

* identity (`3` cycles): `4³ = 64`;
* the three transpositions (`2` cycles each): `4² = 16`;
* the two `3`-cycles (`1` cycle each): `4¹ = 4`.

So `Σ_σ tr(permMat σ) = 64 + 3·16 + 2·4 = 120` and `tr(projSym 3) = 120/6 = 20`,
while `Σ_σ sgn(σ)·tr(permMat σ) = 64 − 3·16 + 2·4 = 24` and
`tr(projAnti 3) = 24/6 = 4`.  The mixed piece is `64 − 20 − 4 = 40`.

Everything is proved **without** the `EXTERNAL` Weyl hypothesis, `sorry`-free /
`axiom`-free (only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

## Deliverables

* `trace_projSym_three` — `tr (projSym 3) = 20` (`= dim Sym³V`).
* `trace_projAnti_three` — `tr (projAnti 3) = 4` (`= dim Λ³V`).
* `trace_projMixed_three` — `tr (projMixed 3) = 40` (the mixed-symmetry piece).
* `trace_decomposition_three` — `20 + 4 + 40 = 64 = dim (V ⊗ V ⊗ V)`.
