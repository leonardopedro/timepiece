# One-dimensional distributional regularity: `u'' = c·u` in the weak sense

`CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` §10.6.1/§10.6.2 leaves one gap of the quantum-gravity chapter open:
the *exponentially growing* scalaron wall.  Every route the project has tried so far is a
perturbative one — Kato–Rellich on the Gauss–polynomial core, the Carleman flux criterion
on the Hermite lattice — and both are refuted or inapplicable for a wall that grows faster
than every polynomial (`BookProof/ChapterHermiteExpWall.lean`).

The classical route that *does* reach an arbitrarily fast growing **non-negative** potential
is not perturbative at all: a deficiency vector `u` of `−d²/dx² + V` solves the ordinary
differential equation `u'' = (V − z)u`, and a non-negative `V` makes `|u|²` convex — hence,
being integrable and non-negative, zero.  The step that has to be supplied before the ODE
argument can start is *regularity*: the deficiency vector is a priori only an `L²` function
and the equation it satisfies is a distributional one.

This module supplies exactly that step, in one variable, with no reference to the physics:

* `exists_antideriv` — a test function of vanishing integral is the derivative of a test
  function (the elementary fact that makes the du Bois-Reymond argument work);
* `ae_eq_const_of_integral_deriv_smul_eq_zero` — **du Bois-Reymond**: a locally integrable
  function orthogonal to the derivative of every test function is a.e. constant;
* `ae_eq_affine_of_integral_deriv2_smul_eq_zero` — the second-order version: orthogonal to
  every *second* derivative means a.e. affine;
* `integral_deriv_mul_indefiniteIntegral` — integration by parts against an indefinite
  integral of a merely locally integrable function (through Mathlib's
  `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval` calculus, since such a primitive is differentiable only
  almost everywhere);
* `exists_ae_eq_doubleAntideriv_add_affine` — the real-valued regularity theorem: a weak
  solution of `u'' = G` is a.e. the double antiderivative of `G` plus an affine function;
* **`exists_deriv2_of_weak_eq`** — the complex-valued statement in the form the Schrödinger
  argument consumes: if `u` is locally integrable, `c` is continuous and `∫ g'' u = ∫ g c u`
  for every real test function `g`, then `u` agrees almost everywhere with a genuinely twice
  differentiable `W` satisfying `W'' = c·W` *everywhere*.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`).
