# Chapter G — Gauge transformations in probability spaces

This file formalizes the self-contained mathematical backbone of the book's
chapter *"Gauge symmetry and dissipative dynamics in probability spaces"*
(book line 2128), following work-package **N6** of `FORMALIZATION_ROADMAP.md`.

Sections G.0–G.7:
* G.0 the gauge group of a parametrization,
* G.1 orbits = fibers; gauge-invariance ⇔ factoring through `π`,
* G.2 gauge-invariant subalgebras; gauge-independence of expectation values,
* G.3 the Dirac obstruction (no shift-invariant state on `ℤ`),
* G.4 gauge-fixing sections always exist,
* G.5 Haar averaging (invariantization) and the pushforward headline,
* G.6 the BRST ghost algebra (nilpotency),
* G.7 dissipative dynamics: Koopman evolution.

None of these needs an `EXTERNAL` hypothesis; everything is `sorry`-free.
