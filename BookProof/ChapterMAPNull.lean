# MAP points are null under an atomless posterior

This file formalizes the next self-contained claim in the Bayesian discussion of
`book.tex` around lines 1713--1720.  The book observes that, on a continuous
sample space, a maximum of the posterior has null measure: posterior sampling
may land near such a point, but almost surely does not land exactly there.

The measure-theoretic content does not depend on how the maximizer was selected.
Under an atomless measure every singleton is null, every countable collection of
maximizers is null, and a random posterior sample almost surely avoids it.
