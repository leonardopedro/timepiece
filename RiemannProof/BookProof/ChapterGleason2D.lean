# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §4 —
# Quantum Mechanics versus a non-commutative generalization of probability theory

This file formalizes the concrete **2-dimensional real** comparison with Gleason's
theorem given in the `book.tex` chapter *"Wave-function parametrization of a
probability measure"*, section *"4. Quantum Mechanics versus a non-commutative
generalization of probability theory"* (`book.tex` line ~1550).

The book contrasts the wave-function parametrization (which uses only *commuting*
projections, hence pure states) with Gleason's theorem (which handles
*non-commuting* projections and requires mixed states). It exhibits two
non-commuting rank-one projections on `ℝ²`,

* `P₁ = !![1,0;0,0]`  (projection onto the first axis), and
* `Q  = ½ !![1,1;1,1]` (projection onto the diagonal `(1,1)`),

together with the two expectation constraints
`tr(ρ P₁) = ½` and `tr(ρ Q) = ½`, and observes:

* there **is** a *pure* state realizing each constraint separately;
* there is **no** *pure* state realizing **both** simultaneously; yet
* the *mixed* state `ρ = ½·I` realizes both.

We model a real pure state by a unit vector `v : Fin 2 → ℝ` through the rank-one
density matrix `ρ = v vᵀ = Matrix.vecMulVec v v`, and the expectation by the
trace `tr(ρ A)`.  A short computation gives the two expectation formulas
`tr(v vᵀ · P₁) = v₀²` and `tr(v vᵀ · Q) = (v₀+v₁)²/2`, from which every claim
follows.
