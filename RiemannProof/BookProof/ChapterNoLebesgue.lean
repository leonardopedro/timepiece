# Chapter (Yang–Mills / Statistical Field Theory) — No infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure

This file formalizes a foundational claim that `book.tex` invokes repeatedly to
justify the whole *free-field / gauge-variant probability measure* framework
(Chapter *"Quantization due to time-evolution: Yang-Mills and Classical
Statistical Field Theory"*, `book.tex` line ~6660, and again in the gauge
chapters, e.g. line 2128):

> "the Feynman's path integral assumes the existence of a translation-invariant
> `σ`-finite (i.e. Lebesgue like) measure … Yet, it is proved that in rigor such
> infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure cannot exist."

The precise mathematical statement is the classical fact that **an
infinite-dimensional normed space carries no non-trivial translation-invariant
Borel measure that is finite on bounded sets** (there is no
"infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure"). This is the rigorous content behind
the book's assertion that a gauge-*invariant* vacuum measure is impossible while
a gauge-*variant* (e.g. Gaussian) one is fine.

## Proof

The engine is Mathlib's `exists_seq_norm_le_one_le_norm_sub`: in an
infinite-dimensional normed space over a complete field there is a bounded
sequence that is `1`-separated. Rescaling it by `2r` produces, for every radius
`r > 0`, infinitely many **pairwise disjoint** open balls of radius `r`, all
contained in one bounded set. If the measure of a ball of radius `r` were
positive, translation invariance would force this bounded set to have infinite
measure — contradicting finiteness on bounded sets. Hence every ball has measure
`0`, and since the whole space is a countable union of balls, the measure is
`0`.

Everything here is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).

/-- **Core estimate.** For a translation-invariant measure that is finite on
bounded sets on an infinite-dimensional normed space, every ball centered at the
origin has measure zero.

The proof rescales a bounded `1`-separated sequence by `2r`, obtaining infinitely
many pairwise-disjoint radius-`r` balls inside a single bounded set; positivity
of `μ (ball 0 r)` would make that bounded set have infinite measure.
