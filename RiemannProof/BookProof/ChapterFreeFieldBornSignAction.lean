# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §5 —
# the diagonal sign gauge as an action of the elementary abelian 2-group

Source: `book.tex`, Introduction, section *"Wave-function collapse versus Euler's
formula"* (`book.tex` line ~805) together with the free-field construction of §5
(`book.tex` ~line 1706).

Earlier waves recorded the *combinatorics* of the diagonal `{±1}ⁿ` sign gauge of
the Born map `x ↦ (x_k)²`: each Born fiber is a full orbit of the sign group
restricted to the positive support, `#fiber = 2 ^ (#positive coordinates)`, and
the orbit–stabilizer identity `#orbit · #stabilizer = 2ⁿ`.

This wave records the underlying **group action** itself. Indexing the sign group
by boolean vectors under coordinate-wise `xor` — the elementary abelian
2-group `(Fin n → Bool, ⊕)` — the sign flip `boolFlip b` (flip the sign of the
`k`-th coordinate exactly when `b k = true`) satisfies the action laws:

* the all-`false` vector acts as the identity;
* composition follows the `xor` group law (`boolFlip b₁ ∘ boolFlip b₂ =
  boolFlip (b₁ ⊕ b₂)`);
* every element is an involution;
* each `boolFlip b` preserves the unit sphere and leaves the Born image fixed.

Finally we record when the action is trivial and, in particular, that it is
**free on the strictly positive sphere** (`boolFlip b x = x ↔ b = 0` when every
coordinate of `x` is nonzero) — the group-theoretic reason the generic Born fiber
has the full `2ⁿ` elements.

## Main results

* `boolFlip_pm` — the sign vector of a boolean flip is `±1`.
* `boolFlip_false` — the all-`false` vector acts as the identity.
* `boolFlip_comp` — composition realizes the `xor` group law.
* `boolFlip_involutive` — every flip is an involution.
* `boolFlip_mem_sphere` — the action preserves the unit sphere.
* `bornMap_boolFlip` — the Born image is fixed by the action.
* `boolFlip_eq_self_iff` — `boolFlip b x = x` iff `b` is `false` on every
  nonzero coordinate of `x`.
* **headline** `boolFlip_free_of_pos` — the action is free on the strictly
  positive sphere: `boolFlip b x = x ↔ b = fun _ => false` when every coordinate
  of `x` is nonzero.

Everything is intended to be `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.

`boolFlip` as an action of the elementary abelian 2-group `(Fin n → Bool, ⊕)`.

coordinate of `x` is nonzero, the diagonal sign action is free: `boolFlip b x = x`
forces `b` to be the identity `fun _ => false`. This is the group-theoretic
reason the Born fiber over a strictly positive distribution has the full `2ⁿ`
