# Chapter "Reconstructing the classical trajectory of any isolated quantum system"
— the density-matrix / trace form of the main result
*"Time translation is a stochastic process if and only if it is deterministic"*

This file formalizes the **literal density-matrix statement** of the section
*"Time translation is a stochastic process if and only if it is deterministic"*
(`book.tex` line ~2613), one of the book's stated *"main results"*.

The book reduces the existence of a group action of a Wigner symmetry group on the
probability distribution to the equality, for every pure state `ρ_g = |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|`,
every outcome `A = a` (rank-one projection `P_a = |e_a⟩⟨e_a|`) and every unitary
`U`, of the two Born probabilities

* `tr(diag(ρ_g) · U P_a U†)` — the probability obtained if the state first
  *collapses* to its diagonal (classical) part and then the transformation acts, and
* `tr(ρ_g · U P_a U†)` — the probability obtained if the transformation acts on the
  full quantum state.

The book then observes this equality is equivalent to the vanishing of the
off-diagonal Born sum `∑_{k≠b} conj(U k a)·Ψ k·conj(Ψ b)·U b a`, which is in turn
equivalent to `U` being *deterministic* (each column has at most one nonzero
entry). The off-diagonal core `↔` determinism is already established in
`BookProof.ChapterReconstruct` (`offDiag_eq_zero_iff_isDeterministic`,
`offDiag_unit_iff`). This file supplies the missing **density-matrix layer**: it
identifies the two matrix traces with the full/collapsed Born sums, shows their
difference is exactly the off-diagonal sum, and packages the headline equivalence

    (∀ a Ψ, tr(diag(ρ Ψ) · U P_a U†) = tr(ρ Ψ · U P_a U†)) ↔ IsDeterministic U

both over all states and over pure states (`∑ ‖Ψ k‖² = 1`).

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`).
