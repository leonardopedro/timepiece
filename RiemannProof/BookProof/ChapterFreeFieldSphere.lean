# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §5 —
# the uniform measure on the sphere from the Gaussian is rotation-invariant

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Wave-function parametrization of a probability
measure"*, section *"5. Free field parametrization in Bayesian inference and
Statistical Mechanics"* (`book.tex` line ~1706):

> "it is well known since many decades that a uniform (Lebesgue-like) measure of
> an infinite-dimensional sphere can be defined using the Gaussian measure and
> the Fock-space."

`ChapterFreeFieldGaussian` proved the finite-dimensional heart of §5 — the
standard Gaussian prior on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is invariant under every
orthogonal transformation.  This file takes the explicit **next step**: the
Gaussian is pushed to the unit sphere by radial normalization
`x ↦ ‖x‖⁻¹ • x`, and the resulting measure — the book's *uniform measure on the
sphere built from the Gaussian* — is itself rotation-invariant.  This is exactly
because radial normalization commutes with orthogonal maps (which preserve the
norm), so the invariance of the Gaussian transports to the sphere measure.

## Main results

* `sphereGaussian` — the pushforward of `stdGaussian n` under radial
  normalization; the "uniform measure on the sphere" built from the Gaussian.
* `instance : IsProbabilityMeasure (sphereGaussian n)`.
* **headline** `sphereGaussian_map_linearIsometryEquiv` — for every orthogonal
  map `L`, `(sphereGaussian n).map L = sphereGaussian n`.

Everything is intended to be `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.
