# Chapter B — Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure

Formalization of the headline result of Chapter B of `book.tex`
(see `FORMALIZATION_ROADMAP.md` §B): every probability density is the Born rule
`|Ψ|²` of a unit vector `Ψ ∈ L²`, and conversely; and a unit vector is the image
of a basis vector under a unitary (`Ψ = 𝒰 e₀`).

**Theorem B.1 (forward / square root).** For every probability density `p`
(measurable, nonnegative, integral `1`) there is a unit vector `Ψ ∈ L²` with
`|Ψ|² = p` almost everywhere. One may take `Ψ = √p`.

**Corollary B.2′ (regular conditional density / disintegration).** On a standard
Borel space the joint probability measure `ρ` on `X × Y` induced by a Born density
`p = |Ψ|²` admits a regular conditional probability: `ρ` factors as the
composition-product of its `X`-marginal `ρ.fst` with the conditional kernel
`ρ.condKernel` (the book's `p(y|x)`).  This is Mathlib's disintegration for
standard Borel spaces; no external theorem is required.
