# Chapter A.4(b) — Prop 61 unitarity (work-package N4)

Source: `book.tex` §A.4 (line 5636), **Proposition 61** — the first of the four
"unitarity by direct computation" statements of §A.4 (the roadmap's tractable
core, together with Props 73/74/76 in `ChapterA4.lean`).

## The book statement

If `U : Pinor_j(ℝ³) → Pinor_j(𝕏)` is unitary intertwining the squared
Hamiltonians `U ∘ H² = E² ∘ U` (with `iH = γ⁰∂̸ + iγ⁰m`, `E(X) ≥ m ≥ 0`), then
```
U' := (E + U H γ⁰ U†) / (√(E+m)·√(2E))
```
is unitary.  The book proves it by `(U')†U' = 1 = U'(U')†`, using that `E = √(E²)`
commutes with `U H γ⁰ U†`, the Dirac anticommutator `γ⁰H + Hγ⁰ = 2m`, and
`H² = U† E² U`.

## What is formalized here

The mathematical heart is a **C\*-algebra identity**.  Writing `c := U H γ⁰ U†`
(so `c† = U γ⁰ H U†`), the Dirac anticommutator `{γ⁰, H} = 2m` together with
`(γ⁰)² = 1` gives the two structural relations
```
c + c† = 2m · 1                    (real part of c is the mass m)
E² = c† c   (= c c†)               (E is the modulus |c|, E = √(c†c))
```
and then a pure ring computation shows
```
(E + c†)(E + c) = 2E(E+m) = (E + c)(E + c†),
```
so dividing by the positive normaliser `p := √(2E)·√(E+m)` (with `p² = 2E(E+m)`)
makes `U' := p⁻¹(E + c)` a unitary: `U'†U' = 1 = U'U'†`.

* `BookProof.prop61_unitary_core` — the abstract engine: in any `ℂ`-*-algebra,
  given `c` with `c + c† = 2m·1`, a self-adjoint `E` with `E² = c†c` commuting
  with `c`, and a self-adjoint normaliser `p` with `p² = 2E² + 2m·E` invertible
  with inverse `q` (a self-adjoint element commuting with `E` and `c`), the
  element `U' := q(E + c)` satisfies `U'†U' = 1 = U'U'†`, i.e. is unitary.  This
  *is* Prop 61's `(U')†U' = 1 = U'(U')†` argument.

* `BookProof.prop61_energyMap_unitary` — the C\*-algebra existence wrapper: for
  `c` with `c + c† = 2m·1` (`m ≥ 0` real) and `c` a unit, the positive square
  roots `E := √(c†c)` and `p := √(2E² + 2m·E)` exist (continuous functional
  calculus), are invertible, and satisfy the hypotheses of the core, so
  `U' := p⁻¹(E + c)` is genuinely a unitary.

**Prop 61 (book), abstract C\*-algebra core.**

In a `ℂ`-*-algebra, suppose `c` has "real part `m`" in the sense
`c + c† = (2m)·1`, that `E` is a self-adjoint element with `E² = c†c` commuting
with `c` (the modulus `E = |c| = √(c†c)`), and that `p` is a self-adjoint
normaliser with `p² = 2E² + (2m)·E = 2E(E+m)` which is invertible with inverse
`q` (self-adjoint, commuting with `E` and `c`).  Then `U' := q·(E + c)` is a
**unitary**: `U'†·U' = 1` and `U'·U'† = 1`.

This is the book's `(U')†U' = 1 = U'(U')†` computation for
`U' = (E + U H γ⁰ U†)/(√(E+m)·√(2E))`.

**Prop 61 (book), C\*-algebra existence form.**

For an element `c` of a C\*-algebra with `c + c† = (2m)·1` for a real `m ≥ 0` and
`c` invertible, the positive square roots `E := √(c†c)` and
`p := √(2E² + (2m)·E)` exist and are invertible, and `U' := p⁻¹·(E + c)` is a
unitary: `U'†·U' = 1` and `U'·U'† = 1`.  (Here `iH`, `γ⁰`, `U`, `E` are packaged
into the single element `c := U H γ⁰ U†`, whose modulus is the energy operator.)
