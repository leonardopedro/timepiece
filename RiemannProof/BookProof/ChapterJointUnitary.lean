# Chapter B §3 — Any finite joint probability distribution is parametrized by a unitary matrix

Formalization of the self-contained, finite-dimensional core of the `book.tex`
section *"3. Any conditional probability measure in a standard measure space is
parametrized by a unitary operator"* (Chapter *"Wave-function parametrization of
a probability measure"*, book line ~1392).

The book states that any joint probability density `p(x,y)` can be written as
`p(x,y) = |𝒰(y,x,0)|²` for a unitary operator `𝒰`, built "through the
Gram–Schmidt process" so that a chosen column of `𝒰` reproduces the wave-function
`Ψ` with `|Ψ|² = p`; and conversely, any bounded operator `B` with
`tr(B Bᴴ) = 1` defines a joint probability distribution `p = |B|²`.

Here we formalize the finite-dimensional matrix version, which is the concrete
content of the "Gram–Schmidt" construction (the abstract `L²` / Hilbert-basis
version is `BookProof.ChapterB.unit_vector_extends`).  Working over a finite index
type, the deliverables are:

* `exists_unitary_column` — every unit vector `v` (with `∑ᵢ ‖v i‖² = 1`) is a
  column of some unitary matrix (extend `v` to an orthonormal basis of
  `EuclideanSpace ℂ ι`; the coordinate matrix of that basis is unitary and its
  `i₀`-th column is `v`);
* `exists_unitary_of_prob` — every finite probability distribution `p` is the
  squared modulus `|·|²` of a column of a unitary matrix (apply the previous
  result to `v i = √(p i)`);
* `exists_unitary_joint` — the book's exact two-space statement: every joint
  probability distribution `p(x,y)` on a finite `X × Y` is `|U|²` on a column of
  a unitary matrix indexed by `X × Y`;
* `sqAbs_isProb_of_frobenius_one` — the converse: any matrix `B` with
  `∑_{i,j} ‖B i j‖² = 1` (i.e. `tr(Bᴴ B) = 1`) makes `(i,j) ↦ ‖B i j‖²` a
  genuine probability distribution.

**Crux (Gram–Schmidt / column of a unitary).** Every unit vector `v` over a
finite index type — meaning `∑ᵢ ‖v i‖² = 1` — is the `i₀`-th column of some
unitary matrix `U`.  This is the finite-dimensional form of the book's claim
that the wave-function `Ψ` can be completed to a unitary `𝒰` with a chosen column
equal to `Ψ`.
