# Chapter C — Entropy and irreversible deterministic time-evolution coexist

This file formalizes the one rigorous mathematical nugget of Chapter C of `book.tex`
(the "vanishing probability of an invertible partition map"), as specified in
`FORMALIZATION_ROADMAP.md` §C.1.

Partition `[0,1]²` into `n²` equal squares; index rows/columns by `Fin n`.
A "discrete function" is any `f : Fin n → Fin n`; it is *invertible* iff it is a
bijection (a permutation).  Under the uniform measure on `(Fin n)^(Fin n)`
(all `nⁿ` functions equally likely), the probability that `f` is invertible is
`n!/nⁿ`, which is asymptotic to `√(2πn)·e⁻ⁿ` and tends to `0`.
