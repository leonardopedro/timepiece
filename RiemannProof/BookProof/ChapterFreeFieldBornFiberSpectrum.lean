# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §5 —
# the full spectrum of Born-fiber cardinalities

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Wave-function parametrization of a probability
measure"* — the free-field construction of §5 (`book.tex` ~line 1706) and the
Introduction's remark (`book.tex` ~line 805) that the wave function is *one
possible* parametrization of a probability distribution.

Waves 151–155 computed the exact Born-fiber count
`Nat.card (bornMapSphere ⁻¹' {p}) = 2 ^ (#positive coordinates of p)`, gave the
sharp two-sided bound `2 ≤ #fiber ≤ 2ⁿ`, and characterized the two extremes.

This wave records the **structural shape** of the fiber cardinality and pins
down the *entire spectrum* of values it takes:

* every fiber size is an **even power of two** dividing `2ⁿ`;
* the fiber size is **monotone** in the positive support;
* and — building an explicit `k`-point uniform distribution — **every** value
  `2ᵏ` with `1 ≤ k ≤ n` is attained, and no others.  Hence the set of achievable
  fiber cardinalities is exactly `{2ᵏ : 1 ≤ k ≤ n}`.

## Main results

* `bornFiber_card_even` — `2 ∣ #fiber`.
* `bornFiber_card_isPowerOfTwo` — `∃ k, 1 ≤ k ∧ k ≤ n ∧ #fiber = 2 ^ k`.
* `bornFiber_card_dvd_two_pow_n` — `#fiber ∣ 2 ^ n`.
* `bornFiber_card_mono` — `posSupport p ⊆ posSupport q → #fiber p ≤ #fiber q`.
* `unifDist` — the uniform distribution on the first `k` coordinates, with
  `posSupport` of cardinality `k`.
* `exists_bornFiber_card_eq_two_pow` — for `1 ≤ k ≤ n` some distribution has
  fiber cardinality `2 ^ k`.
* **headline** `bornFiber_card_achievable_iff` — a number `c` is the cardinality
  of some Born fiber iff `c = 2 ^ k` for some `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.

Everything is intended to be `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.

Every Born fiber has an even number of points: the global `±1` sign is
always a free involution, so the exponent `#positive coords` is at least `1`.
