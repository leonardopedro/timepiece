# Chapter "Wave-function parametrization of a probability measure", §5 —
# the orientation-preserving sign gauge as an index-two kernel

The preceding files represent the diagonal Born sign gauge by orthogonal
matrices, identify orientation preservation with even Hamming weight, and count
the orientation-preserving choices. This file records the corresponding
algebraic structure: the orientation-preserving choices contain the identity,
are closed under the boolean `xor` group law, and the parity of an `xor` is even
exactly when its two inputs have the same parity. Thus the even choices form the
kernel of the determinant/sign character, while the odd choices form its other
coset.

## Main results

* `orientationPreserving_false` — the identity sign choice preserves orientation.
* `orientationPreserving_xor` — orientation-preserving choices are closed under
  coordinate-wise `xor`.
* `even_flipCount_xor_iff` — an `xor` has even weight exactly when its inputs
  have the same parity.
* `orientationPreserving_xor_iff` — matrix form of the index-two kernel/coset law.
