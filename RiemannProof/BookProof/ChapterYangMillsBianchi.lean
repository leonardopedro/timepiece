# Chapter "Quantization due to time-evolution: Yang-Mills and Classical Statistical Field Theory", §"Pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory" — the covariant derivative and the Bianchi (Jacobi) identity

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Quantization due to time-evolution: Yang-Mills and
Classical Statistical Field Theory"*, §*"Pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory"*
(line ~7010).

Continuing `ChapterYangMillsSU3.lean` (the structure constants), this file
formalizes the next self-contained algebraic content of the same section: the
covariant derivative

```
D_j = ∂_j - i g T_a A_{j a},        [D_j, D_k] = -i g T_a F_{j k a}
```

and the **Jacobi (Bianchi) relation** the book states for it,

```
ε_{i j k} [D_i, [D_j, D_k]] = 0.
```

All of this is purely algebraic: the covariant derivatives `D_i` are elements of
an (arbitrary, associative, possibly non-commutative) ring `R`, and their
commutator `⁅·,·⁆ = a*b - b*a` is the ambient Lie bracket.  The field strength
`F_{j k} = ⁅D_j, D_k⁆` is antisymmetric, and the Levi-Civita contraction of the
double commutator vanishes — an immediate consequence of the Jacobi identity
`lie_jacobi`.  This is exactly the identity underlying the vanishing of the
covariant divergence of the magnetic field (`∇·B = 0` / the homogeneous
Yang-Mills equation) that the book records right after introducing `B_{i a}`.

* `eps` — the Levi-Civita symbol on `Fin 3`;
* `fieldStrength` — `F_{j k} = ⁅D_j, D_k⁆`, the commutator of covariant
  derivatives;
* `fieldStrength_antisymm` — `F_{j k} = - F_{k j}`;
* `bianchi_cyclic` — the cyclic Jacobi identity for the double commutators;
* `bianchi` — the book's `ε_{i j k} [D_i, [D_j, D_k]] = 0`;
* `bianchi_fieldStrength` — the same written with the field strength,
  `ε_{i j k} [D_i, F_{j k}] = 0`.
