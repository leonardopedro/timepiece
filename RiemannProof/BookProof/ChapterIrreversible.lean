# Chapter "Reconstructing the classical trajectory of any isolated quantum system"
— §"Symmetries as irreversible processes"

Source: `book.tex`, chapter *"Reconstructing the classical trajectory of any
isolated quantum system"*, subsection *"Symmetries as irreversible processes"*
(line ~2679).

The book argues: *"A non-deterministic symmetry transformation, when acting on a
deterministic ensemble increases the entropy of the ensemble after the
wave-function collapse and therefore must be an irreversible transformation."*
Conversely, if the symmetry is deterministic then the ensemble stays a
deterministic ensemble and the entropy is preserved (equal to `0`), so the
transformation is reversible. This is the entropy counterpart of the main
result of the chapter (*"time translation is a stochastic process if and only
if it is deterministic"*).

This file formalizes the self-contained information-theoretic core of that claim.

* A *deterministic ensemble* is a point mass (`IsPointMass`): the state of the
  system is known, so the probability vector is concentrated on one outcome.
* Acting with a Wigner symmetry `U` and collapsing the wave-function turns the
  initial basis state `e_k` into the **Born distribution** `bornDist v`, where
  `v = U e_k` is the corresponding column: `p_a = ‖v a‖²`.
* `entropy` is the Shannon entropy `∑_a negMulLog (p a) = ∑_a -p a · log (p a)`.

Headlines:

* `entropy_pointMass_zero` — a deterministic ensemble has entropy `0`.
* `entropy_nonneg` — the entropy of any probability vector is `≥ 0`.
* `entropy_pos_of_not_pointMass` — a non-deterministic ensemble has entropy `> 0`.
* `entropy_eq_zero_iff_pointMass` — entropy `0` **iff** deterministic ensemble.
* `entropy_bornDist_eq_zero_iff` — for a unit column `v`, the collapsed ensemble
  has entropy `0` **iff** `v` is a *deterministic column* (the symmetry maps the
  deterministic ensemble to a deterministic ensemble): the *reversible* case.
* `entropy_bornDist_pos_iff` — for a unit column `v`, the collapsed ensemble has
  entropy `> 0` **iff** `v` is *not* a deterministic column: the symmetry
  strictly increases the entropy — the *irreversible* case.

Everything is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free (only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`); no `EXTERNAL` hypothesis, no `axiom`.
