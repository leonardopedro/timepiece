/-! ### M5 / N1. The `O(k)` comparator-circuit upgrade of the NP side

`model_P_ne_NP_circuit` strengthens the NP side of `model_P_ne_NP`: instead of
merely asserting computability of the verifier (`verifyBits_computable`), it
exhibits, for every resolution `k ≥ 1`, an explicit Boolean comparator
`Circuit (3*k) (s+1)` of size `s ≤ 50*k + 50` (built in `Comparator.lean`) that
decides `verifyBits glo ghi u = (glo ≤ u ∧ u ≤ ghi)` on three `k`-bit numbers
packed little-endian by `bitsOf`. The big-endian ripple comparator is driven by
the bit recursion `div_pow_succ_compare` (now in `Comparator.lean`). This is a
NEW theorem stated beside `model_P_ne_NP`; the latter is left untouched, and the
development remains sorry-free and axiom-free. -/

/-- **T3, circuit form (N1).** In the model of `pnp.tex` §§3–6: verification of
    a candidate output is performed by an explicit `O(k)`-size Boolean circuit
    (a comparator on the `k`-bit dyadic data), while no deterministic machine
    computes the selected function on a set of priors of full measure.

    This is a theorem **about this model**. It is NOT the Clay Millennium
    statement `P ≠ NP`, and no claim of implication is formalized — see Part 6
    of `PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. -/

          C.eval (bitsOf k glo ghi u) = verifyBits glo ghi u) ∧

/-! ### T5. The model/Clay disjointness, made checkable -/

/-- A language `L : ℕ → Bool` — a decision problem on finite (encoded) inputs,
    the kind of object the Clay P vs NP statement quantifies over — *decides
    the selection* `g` when, queried on the encoded triple
    `(resolution, input index, candidate output index)`, it answers exactly
    whether the candidate is the dyadic index of `g`'s output at that
    resolution. This is how a Clay-style language would have to present the
    model's data without being handed the selection as an oracle. -/

/-- **T5: the model/Clay disjointness theorem (Tier C, made checkable).**

    Let `NP` be ANY collection of languages all of whose members are
    computable — as is every faithful formalization of the Clay classes `P`
    and `NP`, since `NP ⊆ EXPTIME` and exponential-time machines are total.
    Then, prior-almost-surely, no member of the collection decides the
    selected function's data: the model's hard object lies outside the entire
    arena in which the Clay problem is played.

    Consequently the model separation `model_P_ne_NP` exhibits no `NP`
    language outside `P`, and the Clay statement says nothing about this
    model: the two statements concern disjoint arenas. This theorem is the
    machine-checked form of that disjointness. It is NOT the Clay Millennium
    statement `P ≠ NP`, it does not define the Clay classes, and no
    implication in either direction between `model_P_ne_NP` and the Clay
    statement is formalized — see Part 6 of `PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. -/

/-! ### T4. Realistic version (§7) — OPEN

The §7 argument ("an approximately-deterministic selection admits no
polynomial-time approximation in the `L^∞` sense, prior-a.s.") is only a sketch
in `pnp.tex`; there is no complete English proof to transcribe, and stating a
precise, non-vacuous, and faithful Lean statement is itself a research task.

Note in particular that a *purely analytic* approximation statement would be
false: polynomials are dense in `C([0,1])` and in `L²([0,1])` (see
`SphereGaussian` / standard Stone–Weierstrass), so every continuous selection
function is uniformly approximable by polynomials.  The §7 claim concerns
*computational* (polynomial-time) approximation, which is a different and
subtler notion.  We therefore deliberately leave T4 unformalized rather than
commit to a possibly-incorrect statement.  See `PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
Part 5/T4. -/
