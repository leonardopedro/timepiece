# The Kopperman formalism, in Lean

This module assembles, as one explicit object, the formalism of
`Kopperman_Tutorial.p.tex` (after Kopperman's 1967 *"The `L_{ω₁,ω₁}`-Theory of
Hilbert Spaces"*): a **separable real Hilbert space** (the "ontological
substrate"), a **countable dense decidable skeleton** (the computable
approximants), and an **atomless probability prior** (the Mehler "uncertainty"
layer — the Gaussian limit of the uniform measure on the high-dimensional
sphere).

Each component is *already proved* elsewhere in `PnpProof/`; here they are named
and packaged so that statements can be made and checked **about the formalism
itself**. Nothing here is new mathematics and nothing here is an axiom: the file
is `sorry`-free and `axiom`-free, like the rest of the development.

What this formalism supports, and where those statements live:
* the model separation `σ` ("computable selections are prior-null while
  verification is cheap"): `model_P_ne_NP`, `model_P_ne_NP_circuit` (`Main.lean`);
* the relationship to the Clay statement: `model_vs_clay_disjointness`
  (`Main.lean`, T5) — proved *inside* this formalism.

What it does **not** support, and must not be made to via an `axiom`: a bridge
`σ → (P ≠ NP)`. See `PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Part 8 / Part 9. The honest way
to test the bridge is to *state it as a theorem and let Lean try to prove it* —
not to assert it as an axiom, which is precisely the act of telling Lean to stop
checking.

/-! ## K-model: "choosing a measure = choosing a model of the formalism"

These results make precise the maintainer's claim that *within the formalism,
choosing a probability measure is choosing a model*. Every model carries an
atomless probability prior (`model_has_prior`); conversely every atomless
probability measure on the substrate is the prior of a model (`formalismOfPrior`,
`prior_surjective_onto_atomless`), so with the substrate (and a canonical
skeleton) fixed the prior-projection is a bijection onto the atomless probability
measures. `koppermanSubstrate` is a concrete witness that the substrate admits a
model.

**Two computational layers — the formalism is not "anti-computable".** The prior
nulls computable *selection* functions (the P-side: `almost_all_not_computable`,
T2). But the formalism *also defines computable NP functions*: the candidate
*verification* is computable (`verifyBits_computable`, M5) — indeed an explicit
`O(k)` Boolean circuit (`model_P_ne_NP_circuit`, N1) — and the decidable dense
skeleton is the layer of *computable approximations* (`pnp.tex` §6/§10: the
verification of a constant output "is in NP", and the formalism rests on a dense
countable basis of computable approximants with computable probabilities). The
separation `model_P_ne_NP` (T3) *is* this coexistence: computable verification with
an a.s.-uncomputable selection. Without the computable layer there would be no NP
side to separate. (Fidelity note: the `skeleton` field here only asserts
`Countable ∧ Dense`; the *computability* of the NP layer is carried by the separate
`Computable`/circuit theorems, not by a field of `Formalism` — see
`PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Part 11, "two computational layers".)

**This is sound model theory of the `Formalism` structure — not a Clay bridge.**
"Model" here means a model of *this formalism*, whose decidable skeleton is indexed
by the standard `ℕ`; that is exactly what is needed to *define* the standard
arithmetic statements, and no model *of set theory* is involved or required. The
reason it still does not yield the Clay statement is **arithmetic, not
foundational**: what the measure establishes is the separation `σ` of
`model_P_ne_NP` (computable selections are prior-null), which is a *different*
arithmetic sentence from "SAT ∉ P" — `model_vs_clay_disjointness` (T5) is the proof
that the two are disjoint (`σ` is blind to any individual decidable language). See
`PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Part 11 (K-model). -/

/-! ## T-conserv: arithmetic truth is invariant across formalism and foundation

`Π⁰₂`-invariance / conservativity. The truth value of an arithmetical sentence —
here a `Π⁰₂` sentence `∀ a, ∃ b, p a b` whose matrix `p` is decidable and ranges
over the *standard* naturals — does **not** depend on which `Formalism` is chosen
as the model, nor on any `ZFSet` ("foundation") parameter. This is the
machine-checkable proxy for the maintainer's directive that *"no prior, and no
foundation, moves a first-order arithmetic truth"* (`PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
Part 11, queue item **F-min**, step (c)): the `Formalism` and `ZFSet` parameters
genuinely appear in the statement and are proved to drop out.

It is **not** an internal meta-logical provability/independence theorem. Lean has
no theory-comparison or provability predicate in mainline Mathlib, so a literal
"the Kopperman base is PA-incomparable / co-consistent" claim is **not** stated
here (Part 11 fences); the import DAG, the `#print axioms` footprint, and this
`T-conserv` invariance are the honest *proxies* for those meta-claims. The reason
the invariance holds is exactly point 4 of Part 11: a `Π⁰₂` sentence over the
standard `ℕ` is absolute, and Lean's `ℕ` has no nonstandard elements, so the
sentence literally *is* the standard arithmetic sentence — the parameters cannot
move it. -/

/-- A `Π⁰₂` arithmetical sentence over the standard naturals, with decidable
matrix `p` (`∀ a, ∃ b, p a b`). "P ≠ NP" has this shape over an NP-complete
language; see `PNP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Part 11. -/
def Pi02 (p : ℕ → ℕ → Bool) : Prop := ∀ a, ∃ b, p a b = true

/-- The interpretation of a `Π⁰₂` sentence *"inside a formalism `F`, over a
foundation `z`"*. It ignores both the `Formalism` and the `ZFSet` parameter,
because the matrix ranges over the standard `ℕ` — that is the whole content of
`T-conserv` below. -/

/-- **T-conserv** (`Π⁰₂`-invariance / conservativity, Part 11 step (c)): the
truth of a `Π⁰₂` arithmetical sentence is invariant under any choice of
`Formalism` (the prior/model) **and** under any choice of `ZFSet` foundation —
the parameters drop out. This is the checked core of "no prior, no foundation
moves an arithmetic truth"; it is a proxy for, not an internal proof of, the
meta-logical co-consistency/standardness claims (see the section docstring and
Part 11 fences). -/
